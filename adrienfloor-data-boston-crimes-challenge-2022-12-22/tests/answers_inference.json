    "MEDIAN_AGE": "\n    The median age coefficient is 2252.7344,\n    therefore the median age is associated with a\n    posistive effect on the number of crime incidents\n",
    "T_STAT": "\n    The t-statistic associated with\n    the median age regressor is 1.820\n    It is computed by the difference between\n    the population mean and the sample mean\n    divided by the standard error\n",
    "P_VALUE": "\nA high P-value (> 0.05) means we can't affirm for sure\nthat the explanatory variable affects the dependent variable.\nTherefore we can't confirm that the median age has an effect\non the incident numbers.\n\n0.128 > 0.05 so the effect is not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level\n0.128 > 0.1 so the effect is not statistically significant at the 90% confidence level\n",
    "INCREASE": "\nThe coeff of PERC_MARRIED_COUPLE_FAMILY is -2115.1839\nWe can therefore say that, holding all other regressors constant,\nincreasing the share of families with a married couple by 1% in the district\nis responsible for decreasing by 2115 the number of incidents \n",
    "LIMITATIONS": "\nA 0.899 r-squared  would mean that 89.9%\nof the variability observed in the target\nvariable is explained by the regression model.\n\nThis is quite 'too good to be true'...\n\nThere are several limitations here : \n- We have a lot of features and maybe not as much observations as needed \n- We are working with the human factor here, and not every incidents can\n  be explained mathematically. There is not necessarily a linear explanation\n  between these factors in the real world.\n- We did not clean much that data and can be in the presence of outliers\n"
